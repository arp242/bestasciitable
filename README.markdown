Is it really the "best"? I don't know. I just wanted a catchy domain, was never
a fan of AsciiTable.Com, and BetterAsciiTable.com was already taken.

The index.html file is generated by gen.py.

It's a bit of a work-in-progress. TODO:

- Mobile experience could probably be improved (certainly the explainer part
  should work well). Not sure how to present the table on mobile though; entire
  point is to present it in four columns to show the relation.
- Test with IE and such.
- Find a way to just show the table for a quick overview while also offering the
  explainer. Maybe put the explainer after the table, or collapse it? Not sure.
- Looks like there's room for one more image.
